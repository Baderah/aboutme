                <h1>Bader Al Hussain</h1>
                <h2>Quantitative Analyst</h2>

                <p>My passion is to excel in the field of financial management and data analysis, particularly related to financial management and analysis. The dynamism of this discipline requires a professional to incessantly update and improve his skills
                    in order to outperform others. Therefore, I continuously hone my competencies by pursuing certifications such as CFA and FRM. Moreover, given increasing role of data science and machine learning skills in future application of financial
                    concepts, I have mastered this role in R and Python languages. </p>
                <p>Concomitantly, I earnestly scan for opportunities where I could apply and further sharpen my abilities to the mutual benefit of my and organizational goals.</p>
